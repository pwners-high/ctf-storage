Just one byte makes all the difference.



## License
Written by: ItzSomebody

Description: Keith made a cool license-checking program but he forgot the flag he used to create the key! To make matters worse, he lost the source code and stripped the binary for his license-generator program. Can you help Keith recover his flag? All he knows is:

    The license key is 4-EZF2M-7O5F4-V9P7O-EVFDP-E4VDO-O
    He put his name (in the form of 'k3ith') as the first part of the flag
    There are 3 underscores
    The flag is in the format hsctf{}
    The flag doesn't have random character sequences (you should be able to read the entire flag easily).
    The flag only contains lowercase English letters and numbers.
    The generator might produce the same keys for different inputs because Keith was too lazy to write the algorithm properly.

Keith went crazy and told me to work on the compiled form of Java instead of the source code. Unfortunately, all decompilers I've tried crash on attempting to decompile. Can you help out?

Help! I got this new lock for Christmas, but I've forgotten the first two values. I know the last value is hsctfissocoolwow. I also managed to grab a copy of their secret key generator. Can you help me out?

Note: submit the first two combo values separated by a space in hex format.
