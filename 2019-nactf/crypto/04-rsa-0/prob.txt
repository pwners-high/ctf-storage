Yavan sent me these really large numbers... what can they mean? He sent me the cipher "c", the private key "d", and the public modulus "n". I also know he converted his message to a number with ascii. For example:

"nactf" --> \x6e61637466 --> 474080310374

Can you help me decrypt his cipher?

Hint1. Read about RSA at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)

Hint2. If you're new to RSA, you may want to try this tool: https://www.dcode.fr/modular-exponentiation

If you like python, try the pow() function!
