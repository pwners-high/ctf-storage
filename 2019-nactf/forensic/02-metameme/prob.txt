The MetaMeme
75
Phil sent me this meme and its a little but suspicious. The meme is super meta and it may be even more meta than you think.

Wouldn't it be really cool if it also had a flag hidden somewhere in it? Well you are in luck because it certainly does!

Hint: Hmm how can find some Meta info about a file type?

Google is your friend :)
